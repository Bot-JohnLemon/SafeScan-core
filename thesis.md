# Information Thesis for the Project:
Development of a web and desktop application (guide):
1. **Planning and Design:**
   - Clearly define the goals and requirements of your program.
   - Design the user interface for both the web and desktop versions using Figma.

2. **Development of the Web Version:**
   - We will adopt a frontend (HTML, CSS, JS with React) and backend (Django Framework) development approach. The frontend handles the user interface, while the backend manages the logic and data handling.
   - We will also use a web development framework or library, using React to complete the user interface and create the web application.

3. **Development of the Desktop Version:**
   - For the desktop version, we will opt for Electron.
   - Design and adapt the user interface specifically for the desktop version, taking into account design and user experience differences.

4. **Common Logic and Database:**
   - Implement the application logic in a way that is shared between both versions. This means that both versions will access the same underlying logic and, if necessary, the database.
   - Use a database to ensure data consistency in your Django Framework backend.

5. **Testing and Debugging:**
   - Conduct thorough testing on both versions to ensure they function correctly and meet the requirements.
   - Resolve any issues or errors encountered during testing.

6. **Distribution and Deployment:**
   - For the web version, you can host it on a web server and ensure it is available online.
   - For the desktop version, compile the application and distribute it on specific operating systems, such as Windows or Linux.

7. **Updates and Maintenance:**
   - Perform regular updates for both versions, ensuring they stay synchronized with new features and bug fixes.

8. **Documentation and Support:**
   - Provide detailed documentation and support to users of both versions.

**Notes:**

- **Frontend Development:**
  - Design User Interface with Figma.
  - Use standard web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  - Apply web development frameworks or libraries like React or Angular to complete the user interface.
    - React is very flexible.
    - Angular is more comprehensive.

- **Backend Development:**
  - Choose a backend technology that suits your needs. Django.
  - Develop Business Logic, such as data management, authentication, authorization, and functions that should not run in the user's browser.
  - Database: Select a database that integrates well with your backend technology. MySQL.
  - Create an API (Application Programming Interface) that allows your frontend to communicate with the backend. Use standards like RESTful or GraphQL to define the API routes and endpoints.

- **Desktop Version Development:**
  - Next, develop the desktop version using the selected technologies.
  - You can use frameworks like Electron to create cross-platform desktop applications.
